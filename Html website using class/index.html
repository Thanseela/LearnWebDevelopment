<h1>I Love Nature</h1>

<p id="main">Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe. </p>
<p>"Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.</p>
<p>The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.</p> 
<p>Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena</p>
